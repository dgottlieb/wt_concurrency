# A single MongoDB crud transaction will:
#  1) Write A
#  2) SetTimestamp T
#  3) Write B
# Intending for timestamp T to apply to both A and B. Concatenating
# two crud operations gives:
#  1) Write A
#  2) SetTimestamp T
#  3) Write B
#  4) Write C
#  5) SetTimestamp T+1
#  6) Write D
# Intending for timestamp T to apply to write's A and B, and T+1
# to apply to C and D. But is that what happens?
#
# It turns out the writes to B and C are visible at T, however A
# and D are not.
